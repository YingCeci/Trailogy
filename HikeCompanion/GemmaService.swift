// GemmaService.swift
// Wraps mlx-swift-lm's `ChatSession` over Gemma 4 E2B (INT4 quantized,
// ~2.8 GB on disk after audio-tower strip).
//
// DUAL-MODE LOADER (Phase 3b)
// ---------------------------
// We can load Gemma in two flavours:
//
//   .text  → MLXLLM.LLMModelFactory  (filters vision + audio at sanitize() →
//            ~2.5 GB MLX active, ~10–30 s cold load)
//   .vlm   → MLXVLM.VLMModelFactory  (filters audio only; keeps vision tower →
//            ~3.2 GB MLX active, ~13–37 s cold load)
//
// Each Ask calls `loadIfNeeded(kind)` with the kind appropriate for the
// turn (text-only vs. has-photo). If a different kind is currently
// loaded, we unload it first. After the response streams + Kokoro
// speaks, we unload to bring memory back to ~100 MB idle, same as the
// text-only flow we shipped earlier.
//
// LIFECYCLE
// ---------
//   • Lazy load on first Ask. App launches with only Kokoro resident.
//   • Unloaded after each generation completes (caller's responsibility).
//   • Conversation history is preserved as plain text across loads, so a
//     follow-up text Ask after an image Ask still has context — Gemma
//     just doesn't see the image bytes again, only the text it produced
//     last turn.
//   • `reset()` wipes history without unloading.
//
// COST
// ----
//   • Each Ask after the first pays a 10–37 s reload again. Multi-turn
//     coherence preserved; memory bounded between turns.
//
// HISTORY (capped at 20 messages = 10 turns)
//   • Every (user, assistant) pair appended after stream completion.
//   • Replay during prefill keeps the KV cache transient. At ~100
//     tokens/turn for Q&A, prefill is ~3–5 s on iPhone — small compared
//     to the load.
