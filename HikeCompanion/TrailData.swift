// TrailData.swift
// Static sample data taken from design/mockups.html. The mockup demonstrates
// a "Kildoo Trail" tour at McConnells Mill State Park with 5 stops; we keep
// the same content so the implementation matches the design 1-to-1.
//
// The trail/stop *imagery* in the mockup uses Wikimedia URLs; we reference
// those by URL too — SwiftUI's `AsyncImage` will fetch them at runtime.
// (This is fine for the prototype; pre-bundle the photos later if you want
// the app to work fully offline at the trailhead.)
//
// Real GPS positioning, real downloads, and real per-trail content all
// require infrastructure we don't have yet. For now the data is a frame.
