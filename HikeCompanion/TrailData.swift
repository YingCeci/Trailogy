// TrailData.swift
// Static sample data taken from design/mockups.html. The mockup demonstrates
// a "Kildoo Trail" tour at McConnells Mill State Park with 5 stops; we keep
// the same content so the implementation matches the design 1-to-1.
//
// The trail/stop *imagery* in the mockup uses Wikimedia URLs; we reference
// those by URL too — SwiftUI's `AsyncImage` will fetch them at runtime.
// (This is fine for the prototype; pre-bundle the photos later if you want
// the app to work fully offline at the trailhead.)
//
// Real GPS positioning, real downloads, and real per-trail content all
// require infrastructure we don't have yet. For now the data is a frame.

        Welcome to the Tranquil Trail in Frick Park — Pittsburgh's \
        largest historic park. This is a short out-and-back walk: a \
        mile and a tenth from start to turnaround and back, about \
        thirty minutes at a comfortable pace, rated easy. The trail \
        begins off Beechwood Boulevard and drops gently into the \
        valley of Fern Hollow Creek, which empties into Nine Mile \
        Run downstream. The forest here regrew over a century after \
        logging, and the path passes through mature stands of oak \
        and tulip poplar — some of these trees are over a hundred \
        and fifty years old. Listen for thrushes and woodpeckers, \
        watch for spicebush and witch hazel in the understory, and \
        take your time. We'll turn around at Forest Grove.
