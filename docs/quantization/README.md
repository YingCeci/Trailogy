# Gemma 4 E2B — Quantization Experiments

## TL;DR

- This folder is the public index for Gemma 4 E2B deploy-time quantization: the goal is an SFT'd 4-bit checkpoint under 4 GB with minimal PlantNet accuracy loss.
- The docs compare three routes: 4-bit-aware SFT, a CUDA/HF post-training path, and an MLX-native path that can produce the iOS artifact.
- The current recommended artifact comes from the MLX-native route; the CUDA/HF route remains useful as an independent accuracy and size cross-check.
- Start with `00-quantization-report-pub.md` for headline results, then use the route-specific files for reproduction details and failure analysis.

Engineering notes for the deploy-time quantization sweep. Companion to
the code in `src/quantization/`. The goal: produce a quantized SFT'd
Gemma 4 E2B under 4 GB on disk (target ~3.0-3.6 GB) with minimal
accuracy drop on PlantNet.

Route A (4-bit SFT) docs are prefixed `A-`. Route B.1 (HF/CUDA) and
B.2 (MLX deploy) live alongside.
